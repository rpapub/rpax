# rpax Backlog â€” Composed Artifacts

This backlog lists **composed artifacts** that can be built on top of the core parser/validator/access layers.  
Each item reuses canonical artifacts (`manifest.json`, `workflows.index.json`, `invocations.jsonl`, `activities.*/*`, `paths/*`) to generate higher-level views for developers, CI, or documentation.

## Notes

- **Phasing**: v0.1 items are documentation-oriented and easy wins once parser is stable.  
- **v0.2** brings analysis & CI-driven outputs (dependency, impact, governance).  
- **v0.3** focuses on onboarding & high-level architecture views.  
- All ideas build only on parser outputs; no extra parsing or Studio dependencies.  

---

## Next Steps

- Refine inputs/outputs into draft ADRs (one per composed artifact).  
- Prioritize v0.1 deliverables for quick developer value.  
- Collect feedback from early users to shape v0.2 focus (CI integration vs. docs).
