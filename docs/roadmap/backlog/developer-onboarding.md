# Developer Onboarding Enhancement - Comprehensive Backlog

**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Developer Experience  
**Effort**: Medium-Large (20-30 hours)  
**Dependencies**: Current documentation review, user feedback  
**Target Version**: v0.4.0+  

---

## Problem Statement

Current rpax codebase lacks comprehensive developer onboarding documentation, creating significant barriers for new contributors. While extensive ADRs and architectural documentation exist, there's no "developer-friendly front door" that enables quick productivity before diving into complex architectural details.

**Evidence of Need:**
- No step-by-step local development setup
- Missing development workflow documentation
- Architecture understanding requires reading 30+ ADRs
- Test running process undocumented
- No debugging or development tools guidance
