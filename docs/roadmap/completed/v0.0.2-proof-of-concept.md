- Consistent path handling across all modules

### ✅ MCP URI compatibility
- Clean resource identifiers for ecosystem integration
- Enables `rpax://projects/{p}/workflows/{wf}` URI scheme
- No path separator issues in resource references

### ✅ Cross-platform resolution
- Eliminates path separator bugs and debugging confusion
- Workflow resolution works reliably across platforms
- Recursive pseudocode expansion functions correctly

- Issue cross-references and technical achievements
- Methodology and quality metrics captured

### ✅ ADR architecture foundation
- 14 comprehensive Architecture Decision Records
- Key decisions documented: parsing strategy, data models, CLI design
- Multi-project lake architecture, JSON Schema configuration
- Foundation for consistent future development

## Major Technical Achievements

### ✅ Layer 1 (Parser) Foundation Complete
- Comprehensive XAML parsing with complete metadata extraction
- Professional CLI commands with rich console output
- Multi-project lake architecture with stable identity system
- Cross-platform compatibility and path normalization

### ✅ Layer 2 (Validation/CI) Complete  
- Validation framework with pluggable rule system
- Missing invocation detection and cycle analysis
- CI-friendly exit codes and reporting formats
- Configuration-driven validation rules

### ✅ Layer 3 (API) Foundation Ready
- CLI decorator system for automatic API generation
- OpenAPI specification generation from metadata
- Service discovery and concurrent request handling
- Foundation established for FastAPI implementation

### ✅ Quality & Testing Excellence
- 249 passing tests with comprehensive integration coverage
- Tested against 5 diverse UiPath corpus projects
- Performance validated: no crashes on real-world projects
- Professional code quality: ruff, black, mypy compliance

## Real-World Validation Evidence

**Test Corpus Results:**
- `c25v001_CORE_00000001`: Core functionality and metadata extraction ✅
- `FrozenChlorine`: Complex project with 21 workflows and test hierarchies ✅  
- `CPRIMA` variants: Edge cases and validation rule testing ✅
- Performance monitoring: Memory usage and processing time tracked ✅

## Architecture Decisions Implemented

- **ADR-001**: Namespace-agnostic XAML parsing for UiPath resilience ✅
- **ADR-014**: Multi-project lake architecture for ecosystem consistency ✅
- **ADR-002**: 4-layer architecture (Parser → Validation → API → MCP) ✅
- **ADR-004**: JSON Schema configuration with zero-config defaults ✅
- **ADR-005**: Mermaid + Graphviz dual visualization support ✅
- **ADR-030**: Path separator normalization strategy ✅

## Public Release Quality

### ✅ Clean Repository Structure
- Professional rollup from messy development history
- Clean main branch with single commit representing all work  
- Tagged v0.0.2 release pointing to clean commit
- No test artifacts or development clutter in public repo

### ✅ Professional Packaging

- All dependencies properly specified and validated
- Build system tested with wheel generation
- Installation workflow verified in clean environments

## Foundation Established for Future Development

**v0.0.2 provides the architectural foundation for:**

### Layer 1 (Parser) - COMPLETE ✅
- Rock-solid CLI with comprehensive functionality
- Complete XAML parsing with metadata extraction  
- Professional packaging and build infrastructure
- API generation foundation with decorator system

### Layer 2 (Validation/CI) - COMPLETE ✅
- Validation framework with configurable rules
- CI-friendly exit codes and reporting
- Cross-project validation capabilities

### Layer 3/4 (API/MCP) - FOUNDATION READY ✅

- Clean URI schemes ready for ecosystem integration

**Next Phase**: v0.0.3 - Resource Model Stabilization to refine parser outputs into consistent, useful resources for downstream consumption.

## Development Methodology Success

The **ADR-driven development with LLM pair programming** methodology proved highly effective:

1. **ADRs as architectural bridge**: Persistent knowledge between LLM sessions
2. **Issue-driven implementation**: TODO.md provided concrete tracking
3. **Quality gates**: Comprehensive testing and real-world validation
4. **Architectural consistency**: ADR consultation maintained design coherence

**Result**: Complex architectural project developed successfully with consistent technical decisions and professional quality outcomes.
