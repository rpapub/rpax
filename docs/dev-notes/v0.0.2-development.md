## üéØ Development Methodology

This development cycle followed the structured 6-step approach documented in CLAUDE.md:

1. **TODO Validation**: Each issue aligned with roadmap priorities and acceptance criteria
2. **Planning & Analysis**: Referenced ADRs for architectural guidance and constraints  
3. **Test-Driven Implementation**: Comprehensive tests covering happy path and edge cases
4. **Validation Cycle**: Full test suite, linting, type checking after implementation
5. **Integration & Milestone Validation**: Validated against real UiPath test projects
6. **Architectural Consistency**: Maintained patterns and ADR compliance throughout

### **Quality Metrics Achieved**
- **Test Coverage**: 249 passing tests with comprehensive integration coverage
- **Performance**: Tested against 5 diverse UiPath corpus projects without crashes
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows development and Linux CI compatibility maintained
- **Code Quality**: Full ruff, black, mypy compliance throughout development

### **Real-World Validation**
All development was continuously validated against real UiPath test projects:
- `c25v001_CORE_00000001`: Core functionality and metadata extraction
- `FrozenChlorine`: Complex project with 21 workflows and test hierarchies  
- `CPRIMA` variants: Edge cases and validation rule testing

## üìù Future Development Guidance

**Branch Strategy**: Future development should branch from the cleaned-up release branch, not the messy development history.

**API Stability**: This v0.0.2 release makes NO guarantees about API stability - CLI commands and interfaces may change freely.

**Performance Baseline**: All future development should maintain the performance characteristics established with corpus project testing.

**Quality Standards**: The comprehensive testing and validation approach established in this cycle should be maintained and enhanced.

---

**Next Major Milestone**: v0.1.0 will focus on API stability, PyPI distribution, and user-facing polish.

**Technical Debt**: The extensive development history in `exploration/cprima` contains valuable technical context but should not be part of public release history.

**Architectural Decisions**: All major architectural decisions are documented in the ADR system and should be consulted for future development direction.
