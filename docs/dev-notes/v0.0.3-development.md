## üìù Development Insights & Lessons

### **Implementation-First Approach Success**
The cycle demonstrated that implementing working solutions first, then documenting architecture, produces better outcomes than extensive upfront planning. The actual implementation far exceeded original planning document scope.

### **Documentation Synchronization Critical**
Regular synchronization between implementation and documentation prevents architectural debt. The formal ADR maintenance process (ADR-000) addresses this systematically.

### **Integration Complexity Management**
The unified pipeline approach successfully managed complexity of integrating activity resources, error collection, and V0 schema without breaking existing functionality.

### **AI-Assisted Development Governance**
Clear processes for AI-assisted development (ADR-000, llm.txt) enable consistent architectural evolution while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions.
